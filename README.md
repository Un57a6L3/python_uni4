# Un57a6L3/python_uni4
This repository is for my Python codes for various tasks in university.
So far, they are all tied to the subject **Python programming**.

The lectures and practices are made by [Peter Sovietov](https://github.com/true-grue)
and can be found at his [kispython](https://github.com/true-grue/kispython) repository.
