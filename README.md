# Python for university semester 4
This repository is for my Python codes for various tasks in university.
So far, they are all tied to the subject **Python programming**.

The lectures and practices are made by
[Peter Sovietov](https://github.com/true-grue)
and can be found at his
[kispython](https://github.com/true-grue/kispython)
repository.

Information about specific tasks and practices can be found
in `.md` files in their folders.
