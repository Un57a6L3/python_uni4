# Practice 2
This folder contains my codes for practice 2 tasks of subject *Python programming*.
The full practice document can be found
[here](https://github.com/true-grue/kispython).
Summary of the tasks is as follows:

### Task 1
Write one-liners for the following tasks:
1. Cast elements of list `s` from string to integer.
2. Count unique elements in sequence `s`
3. Reverse sequence `s` without using functions
4. Return list of indexes of occurrences of element x in sequence `s`
5. Sum elements of list `s` with even indexes
6. Find the longest string in string list `s`
### Task 3
Write a `generate_groups()` function that generates (not just prints)
a list of group names like on the Teacher Digital Assistant [site](http://kispython.ru/).
### Task 5
Write a generator of reports on digital economics.
Data for generation is given in the practice document.
### Task 8
Write a generator of full names. You may use a list of common names,
but you have to generate the last names yourself.
### Task 10
Implement a `parse_subj(text)` function to parse titles of letters with tasks.
It needs to parse the group and variant number.
### Task 11
Implement the direct and inverse BWT (Burrows-Wheeler Transform).
Check how it works with RLE (Run-Length Encoding).
### Task 13
Implement a command line script that forms a tree of directories and files starting from the given path.
The result should be given in [graphviz](https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline/) format.
## Notes:
- I made task 13 in two versions (`pr2-task13.py` and `graphdir.py`). The first one is all defined in code,
the second one has more functionality and takes arguments from the command line. Also it took a lot of time...
